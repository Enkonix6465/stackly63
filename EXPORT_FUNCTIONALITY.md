## Overview

Added comprehensive export functionality to the User Management section in the admin dashboard page. Users can now export user data in multiple formats with a beautiful dropdown interface.

## Features Added

- **JSON Export**: Structured JSON format with metadata (export date, total users)
- **Excel Export**: HTML-based Excel format (.xls) with styling

### 2. **Smart Data Export**

- Exports filtered users when filters are active
- Exports all users when no filters are applied
- Shows real-time count of users being exported in the dropdown

### 3. **User Interface Enhancements**

- **Dropdown Menu**: Clean dropdown with three export format options

### 4. **Exported Data Fields**

Each export includes the following user information:

- User ID
- First Name
- Last Name
- Email
- Status (Active/Inactive)
- Login Time
- Logout Time
- Created At (timestamp)

### 5. **File Naming Convention**

Files are automatically named with timestamps:

- `users_export_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- `users_export_YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- `users_export_YYYY-MM-DD.xls`

3. **`exportToExcel(data, filename)`**: Creates HTML table for Excel compatibility
4. **`handleExport(format)`**: Main handler that orchestrates the export process

### State Management:
